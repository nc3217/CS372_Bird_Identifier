# CS372_Bird_Identifier

## What it Does

This project aims to assist bird watchers and researchers in identifying bird species using image classification. By inputting an image of one of the 1486 bird species that this model is trained on, this model will be able to classify the bird species. This model can be implemented into field cameras that researchers use in fieldwork to allow automatic classification of birds for research purposes instead of relying on human identification. This project compared both a CLIP pretrained model and an EfficientNet model, with the EfficientNet model yielding the best outcomes.

## Quick Start

To set up this project, create a python environment. Then, install python dependencies as indicated in the SETUP.md.

## Evaluation



## Individual Contributions

Irene: Irene worked on much of the baseline modeling. She also worked on the fine-tuning for the EfficientNet model.

Neeharika: Neeharika worked on the CLIP logistic regression baseline model, and she also worked on the inference/testng for the EfficientNet model.
