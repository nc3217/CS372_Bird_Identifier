# CS372_Bird_Identifier

What it Does

This project aims to assist bird watchers and researchers in identifying bird species using image classification. By inputting an image of one of the 1486 bird species that this model is trained on, this model will be able to classify the bird species. This model can be implemented into field cameras that researchers use in fieldwork to allow automatic classification of birds for research purposes instead of relying on human identification.
